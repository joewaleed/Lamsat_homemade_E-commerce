> A full-stack e-commerce platform built for Egyptian homemade artists and craftspeople with fraud protection, integrated online payments, and a 10% platform commission model.

## Problem Statement

In Egypt, thousands of talented homemade artists struggle to sell their work online. Existing platforms like Facebook and Instagram offer no buyer or seller protection, leaving both parties vulnerable to fraud. The absence of trusted online payment methods forces transactions into informal cash exchanges, creating friction and distrust. Lamsat solves this by providing a dedicated, trusted marketplace with built-in fraud protection and seamless payment integration.
